  title: Loops
  text: For this potion, you will need to use an <color="yellow">ingredient<color="white">
    multiple times. Instead of listing the same <color="yellow">ingredient<color="white">
    repeatedly in the recipe, we can use a loop to simplify the process by placing
    the <color="yellow">ingredient<color="white"> directly after the previous one.<br><br>A
    loop is a section of code that repeats a given number of times. This eliminates
    the need to manually repeat the same line, making it especially useful when a
    command needs to be repeated many times.
