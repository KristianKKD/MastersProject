  text: "As a recipe can be imagined as an application, we can also imagine it to
    be a function.<br><br>A function is a block of code, or a set of instructions
    which return a desired output once completed. <br><br>We use functions for easy
    reuse, similar to loops. Unlike loops, functions can take parameters\u2014variables
    that change how they work, but in our case, we won't be using parameters."
