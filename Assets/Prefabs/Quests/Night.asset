  title: Cure for Darkness
  description: Greetings fellow craftsworker!<br> A newly discovered cavern in the
    nearby frost mountains beckons me with its mysterious depths and untold resources
    for my new invention! Alas,  monstrous creatures lurk in the shadows, thwarting
    my every step in the depths, the rascals!! I implore you, please, craft a potion
    of night vision to fend off the darkness and reveal the what was once hidden!
    As a side, please make sure the potion warms me, for the cold pierces even the
    thickest of unicorn fur! <br>In return, I shall reward you with the powerful
    crystals of frost I uncovered in the upper layers and a small sum of my adventure
    fund!
